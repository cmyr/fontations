# codegen

This crate contains utilities used to generate code for parsing and
compiling various font tables. For an in-depth overview of what code we generate
and how it works, see the [codegen-tour][] document.

The basics:
- Inputs live in `resources/codegen_inputs`.
- To run the code generator:
  ```sh
  # Rebuild all the things (normal use case)
  $ cargo run --bin=codegen resources/codegen_plan.toml
  
  # Process a single file
  $ cargo run --bin=codegen file $mode $input
  $ cargo run --bin=codegen file parse resources/codegen_inputs/cmap.rs > read-fonts/generated/generated_cmap.rs
  ```
  where `$input` is the path to an input file, and `$mode` is one of 'parse' or
  'compile', and which will generate the code corresponding to the `read-fonts`
  or `write-fonts` crate, respectively. This will print the output to `stdout`;
  you can redirect it elsewhere as desired.
- But inputs are more commonly run through a 'codegen plan', which describes the
  inputs and their destinations. The default plan lives in `resources/codegen_plan.toml`.
- outputs are written into `$crate/generated/generated_$name.rs` (where `$crate` is one of
  `read-fonts` or `write-fonts`.)
- these output files (which are not in the module tree) are included with the
  [`include!`][] macro into a corresponding module, generally in
  `$crate/src/tables/$name.rs`.


## Adding a new table

- Create a new codegen input file in `resources/codegen_inputs`. The name of
  this file is not important, but in general it should be the name of the
  corresponding table in the spec. Each top-level table (table with a tag) gets
  its own file. To assist with creating this file, you may use the
  [preprocessor](#preprocessor); see below.
- Add a task in `resources/codegen_plan.toml` to generate an output in
  `read-fonts/generated`.
- Add a module corresponding to the new table to the `read-fonts` crate. In
  general this means adding a new file in `read-fonts/src/tables`, and adding an
  entry in `read-fonts/src/tables.rs`. The module should `include!` the
  generated file.
- Run the codegen tool, with
  `$ cargo run --bin=codegen resources/codegen_plan.toml`, and run `cargo check`
  to see if there are any errors.
- If there are any errors, add [attributes](#annotations) as to your table
  as appropriate. Look at other tables for examples.
- Update `read-fonts/src/table_provider.rs` to provide a getter for your table.
- Update `otexplorer` to add support for your table. Run the `otexplorer` tool,
  and ensure it is producing reasonable output.
- Repeat this process for the `write-fonts` crate.


## Modifying the codegen code

It is possible that in adding a table you will need to modify the codegen code
itself, for instance to add a new attribute.

This can be a fiddily process. In general, the workflow is something like this:

- Update `codegen_inputs/test.rs` to include an input matching the input you are
  trying to support.
- Make a modification to the codegen code.
- Run `$ cargo run --bin=codegen resources/test_plan.toml && cargo test` to see
  if the generated code compiles, and inspect to see that it is working as
  intended.
- repeat the edit/test cycle until you are satisfied.

## preprocessor

To speed up writing of the codegen inputs, there is a *preprocessor*, which
takes a simple text input and does basic reformatting into the expected input
format.

The text in the preprocessor inputs (which live in `resources/raw_tables`) is
copied directly from the [Microsoft OpenTypeÂ® docs][opentype]; it is then
augmented with links to the original documentation, and a few basic annotations
to indicate the type of the object (record/table/flags/enums)

Inputs to the preprocessor look like this:

```
/// an optional comment for each top-level item
@table Gpos1_0
uint16      majorVersion       Major version of the GPOS table, = 1
uint16      minorVersion       Minor version of the GPOS table, = 0
Offset16    scriptListOffset   Offset to ScriptList table, from beginning of GPOS table
Offset16    featureListOffset  Offset to FeatureList table, from beginning of GPOS table
Offset16    lookupListOffset   Offset to LookupList table, from beginning of GPOS table

/// Part of [Name1]
@record LangTagRecord
uint16	length	Language-tag string length (in bytes)
Offset16	langTagOffset	Language-tag string offset from start of storage area (in bytes).

/// [Axis value table flags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/stat#flags).
@flags(u16) AxisValueTableFlags
0x0001	OLDER_SIBLING_FONT_ATTRIBUTE	If set, this axis value table provides axis value information
0x0002	ELIDABLE_AXIS_VALUE_NAME	If set, do something else

@enum(u16) GlyphClassDef
1	Base	Base glyph (single character, spacing glyph)
2	Ligature	Ligature glyph (multiple character, spacing glyph)
3	Mark	Mark glyph (non-spacing combining glyph)
4	Component	Component glyph (part of single character, spacing glyph)
```

- all objects are separated by a newline, and begin with `@OBJECT_TYPE`.
- record & table are currently interchangeable, but this may change, and  you
  should follow the spec.
- enum & flags require an explicit format
- this does not handle lifetimes, which will need to be added manually
- it also does not add annotations, which are necessary in any non-trivial case.
- you will generally need to do some cleanup.

run this like,

```sh
$ cargo run --bin preprocessor resources/raw_tables/my_table.txt > resources/codegen_inputs/my_table.rs
```

## codegen

The codegen tool reads in a file in rust-like syntax, and generates the final
rust source.

To run the tool on a single input:

```sh
# cargo run --bin=codegen resources/codegen_inputs/my_table.rs
```

This will write the generated source to stdout; you can redirect it as desired.

### annotations

Codegen inputs can be annotated with various table and field attributes that
inform how the code is generated. These use the same syntax as proc-macro
attributes.

#### table attributes

The following annotations are supported on top-level objects:

- `#[skip_font_write]`: if present, we will not generate a `FontWrite`
  implementation for this type. This is useful if a type needs some manual
  processing before it can be compiled.
- `#[skip_from_obj]`: if present, we will not generate a `FromObjRef`
  implementation for this type.
- `#[read_args(name: type,+)]` if present, this type will be given an
  implementation of `FontReadWithArgs`, expecting the provided arguments. The
  provided names will be available to other attributes on this type, as if they
  were fields on the type itself.
- `#[generic_offset(T)]` Indicate that this type contains an offset with a generic
  target, for which we will add a `PhantomData` field. This is is used for
  common tables that contain offsets which point to different concrete types
  depending on the containing table, such as the `Layout` subtable shared
  between GPOS and GSUB.
- `#[write_fonts_only]` Indicate that this table should only be generated for
  `write-fonts` (i.e. should be ignored in `read-fonts`).
- `#[validate(method)]` Provide a method to perform additional pre-compilation
  validation for this type. The method must be manually implemented on the type,
  with the signature `fn(&self, &mut ValidationCtx)`.

#### field attributes
- `#[nullable]`: only allowed on offsets or arrays of offsets, and indicates
  that this field is allowed to be null. This changes the behaviour of getters,
  as well as validation and compilation code.
- `#[since_version(version)]`: indicates that a field only exists in a given version
  of the table. The `version` may be either a single integer literal
  (`#[since_version(1)]`), or a major.minor pair (`#[since_version(1.1)]`).
- `#[if_flag($field, Flags::SOME_FLAG)]`: indicates that a given field is only
  present if a particular flag is set on the named field. The field is expected
  to be a bitset with a `contains` method.
- `#[if_cond($field, Flags::SOME_FLAG_A, Flags::SOME_FLAG_B, ...)]`: indicates that a
  given field is only present if at least one of the listed flags is set on the named
  field. The field is expected to be a bitset with a `contains` method.
- `#[skip_getter]`: if present, we will not generate a getter for this field.
  Used on things like padding fields.
- `#[offset_getter(method name)]`: only allowed on offsets or arrays of offsets.
  If present, we will not generate a method that resolves this offset, but will
  instead expect that one will be implemented manually, and will have the
  provided name.
- `#[offset_data(method name)]`: only on offset fields. If present, the provided
  'method name' must be implemented, and must return `FontData` that will be
  used to resolve this offset. Used in places where offsets are not resolved
  from the base of the containing table. Uncommon.
- `#[offset_adjustment(expr)]`: related to the above, but for encoding: the
  provided expression must evaluate to a `u32`, which will be subtracted from
  the computed offset during compilation.
- `#[version]`: May only be supplied for one field. If present, this field is
  treated as the 'version', used when determining the availability of versioned
  fields.
- `#[format = x]`: Indicates that this field is the format field of a
  multi-format table, and that it has the provided format value.
- `#[count(arg)]` and `#[count(fn_name(arg, +))]`: This annotation has two
  forms. The simple form accepts a single argument, which can be either
  the token `..` (meaning all remaining data, and only valid on the last field
  in a table), the name of a field (preceded by the `$` token) or a literal
  integer. The less-simple form begins with a function identifier, and then one
  or more arguments, comma separated. Currently accepted function identifiers
  are 'add', 'subtract', 'add_multiply', 'multiply_add', 'half', 'map_delta_size',
  and 'delta_value_count'.
- `#[compile(arg)]`: If present, this field will not be included in the compile
  type. The value may be either the literal 'skip', or an expression that
  evaluates to the field's type: the skip case is only expected in cases where
  there is a manual `FontWrite` impl, and the field does not make sense on the
  compile type.
- `#[compile_with(method_name)]`: Specify custom compilation behaviour. This
  attribute lets you name a method that will be called to get some type that
  will be used to compile this field. This may be any type that implements the
  `FontWrite` trait; this can be used in cases where the logic to compile a
  given type requires some custom implementation.
- `#[compile_type(type)]`: specify an alternate type to be used in the struct
  generated for this type.
- `#[default(expr)]`: specify a value that will be used in the implementation of
  `Default` for the containing type. Unlike with `#[compile]`, this value is set
  when the type is created, and can be manually modified by the user.
- `#[read_with(args,+)]`: specify that this field's type needs to be read with
  `FontReadWithArgs`, and passed the provided args. Args is a comma separated
  list of fields or input args to the type.
- `#[read_offset_with(args,+)]`: on offsets or arrays of offsets, indicates that
  the type referenced by this offset needs to be passed the provided args when
  it is read.
- `#[validate(arg)]`: arg is either the literal 'skip' or the name of a method.
  If the name of a method, that method will be called during validation, and can
  implement custom validation logic.
- `#[traverse_with(method name)]`: uncommon/hacky: provides a method name that
  will be called in traversal code to get the `FieldType` for this field.
  To skip traversing this field, you can use the 'skip' keyword
  (`#[traverse_with(skip)]`).
- `#[to_owned(expr)]`: uncommon/hacky: provide an expression that will be used
  in `FromObjRef` to convert the parse type to the compile type.


### codegen plans

There is also the concept of a 'codegen plan', which is a simple toml file
describing a number of different operations to be run in parallel. This is
intended to be the general mechanism by which codegen is run.

See `../resources/codegen_plan.toml` for an example.
