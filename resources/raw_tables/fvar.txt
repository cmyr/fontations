@table Fvar
uint16	majorVersion	Major version number of the font variations table — set to 1.
uint16	minorVersion	Minor version number of the font variations table — set to 0.
Offset16	axesArrayOffset	Offset in bytes from the beginning of the table to the start of the VariationAxisRecord array.
uint16	(reserved)	This field is permanently reserved. Set to 2.
uint16	axisCount	The number of variation axes in the font (the number of records in the axes array).
uint16	axisSize	The size in bytes of each VariationAxisRecord — set to 20 (0x0014) for this version.
uint16	instanceCount	The number of named instances defined in the font (the number of records in the instances array).
uint16	instanceSize	The size in bytes of each InstanceRecord — set to either axisCount * sizeof(Fixed) + 4, or to axisCount * sizeof(Fixed) + 6.

@record VariationAxisRecord
Tag	    axisTag	        Tag identifying the design variation for the axis.
Fixed	minValue	    The minimum coordinate value for the axis.
Fixed	defaultValue	The default coordinate value for the axis.
Fixed	maxValue	    The maximum coordinate value for the axis.
uint16	flags	        Axis qualifiers — see details below.
uint16	axisNameID	    The name ID for entries in the 'name' table that provide a display name for this axis.

@record InstanceRecord
Fixed	coordinates[axisCount]	Coordinate array specifying a position within the font’s variation space.

@record InstanceRecord
uint16	subfamilyNameID	The name ID for entries in the 'name' table that provide subfamily names for this instance.
uint16	flags	Reserved for future use — set to 0.
UserTuple	coordinates	The coordinates array for this instance.
uint16	postScriptNameID	Optional. The name ID for entries in the 'name' table that provide PostScript names for this instance.
